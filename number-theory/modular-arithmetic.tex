\subsection{Modular Arithmetic}

If $a|b$, then $b = ac$, for some integer c. That means that $b/a$ must be an integer.

If n and d are positive integers, how many positive integers not exceeding n are divisible by d?

In order to be divisible by d, an integer must be of the form $dk$, for some positive integer k.
So the integers divisible by d and not greater than n are the integers with k such that $0 \leq dk < n$
or $0 < k < n/d$.
Thus, the number of integers divisible by d is $\lfloor n / d \rfloor$.

\textbf{Theorem describing the transitive properties of division:}

\begin{equation}
\text{ If $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(b+c)$}
\end{equation}

To prove this use the fact that $a|b$ means that $b = as$, $a|c$ means that $c=at$,
and $b+c = a(s+t)$.
Hence $a|(b+c)$.

\begin{equation}
\text{If $a|b$, then $a|bc$, for $c \in \mathbb{Z}$}
\end{equation}

To prove it use the fact that $a|b$ means $b = as$, so $b*c = as * c$.

\begin{equation}
\text{If $a|b$, and $b|c$, then $a|c$}
\end{equation}

To prove it use $b = as$, $c = bt$. Then $c = bt = ast$ and hence $a|c$.
\\~\\

\textbf{Corollary: If a, b, and c are integers, where $a \neq 0$, such that $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|mb + nc$ whenever $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.}

Use if $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(b+c)$ and if $a|b$, then $a|bc$, for $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, to prove it.

\subsubsection{Division Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $a = dq + r$ where $0 \leq r < d$ and $d>0$
\item $q = a \bdiv d = \lfloor a/d \rfloor$
\item $r = a \pmod d = a - dq$
\end{itemize}

For example, when 101 is divided by 11, $11|101$
$$
101 = 11 \dot 9 + 2
$$

When -11 is divided by 3, $3|-11$
$$
-11 = 3 \dot -4 + 1
$$



\subsubsection{Congruences}

If a and b are congruent modulo m ($a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, m >0$), $a \equiv b \pmod m$, then m divides $a-b$.
Another way of seeing it is that a and b have the same remainder when divided by m.

If m divides $a-b$, then $a-b = mc$ for some integer c.

If both a and b have the same remainders when divided by m, then:
$r = a - mq$ 
$r = b - mp$
$0 = a - mq - b + mp$ or $a - b = mq - mp = m(q-p) = mc$, where $c = q-p$.

The above also means that $a = b + mk$, for some integer k.

Equivalently, \textbf{$a \equiv b \pmod m$ implies that $a \pmod m = a \pmod m$}.
\\~\\

\textbf{Theorem about multiplications and additions in congruences:}

If $a \equiv b \pmod m$ and $c \equiv d \pmod m$, then
\begin{equation}
    a + c \equiv b + d \pmod m
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}
    ac \equiv bd \pmod m
\end{equation}

To prove these, you can use something like the following reasoning:

$a - b = mp$ and $c - d = mq$
$a + c - (b + d) = m(p+q)$

Since $c = d + mq$
$$
ac = (b + mp)(d + mq) = bd + bmq + dmp + mmpq = bd + mc
$$

\textbf{Corollary detailing more forms of addition and multiplication}

\begin{equation}
    (a+b) \bmod m = [(a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)] \bmod m
\end{equation}

To show this,

$a = mk + r = mk + (a \bmod m)$ hence
$a \equiv (a \bmod m) \pmod m$ and so $b \equiv (b \bmod m) \pmod m$
So $a + b \equiv [(a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)] \pmod m$

Because $a \equiv b \pmod m$ implies $a \bmod m = b \bmod m$, the above can be written as
$(a+b) \bmod = [(a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)] \pmod m$.

\begin{equation}
    ab \bmod m = [(a \bmod m)(b \bmod m)] \bmod m
\end{equation}

Following a similar logic as in the above proof, we can obtain the former equation by using $ab \equiv [(a \bmod m)(b \bmod m)] \bmod m$.
