\section{Dynamic Properties of the Monte Carlo Method in Statistical Physics}

These are notes from the paper
"Dynamic Properties of the Monte Carlo Method in Statistical Physics"
by H. Muller-Krumbhaar and K Binder,
\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01008440}{Journal of Statistical Physics, Vol 8, No. 1, 1973}.

References 5, 6, 27, and 28 mention processes for estimating statistical errors.

However, the processes mentioned in ref 28 disregard the knowledge that one can draw from
transition probabilities about the well-defined correlations between subsequent configurations.
