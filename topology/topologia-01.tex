\textbf{Equivalent definitions of the unit circle}

Prove that

$S^1 = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < 1 \}$ and
$S^1 = \{ e^{2\pi it} \in \mathbb{C} : t \in I \}$, where $I$ is the unit cube, are equal.

To prove equivalence of the two definitions of the unit sphere we need to show that every
point satisfying one definition also satisfies the other, and vice versa.

Suppose you have the point $z = a + ib$ on unit circle, where $|z| < 1$.
$z = a + ib = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = r e^{i\theta}$.
$r = 1$ in our case so we will omit it.

Definition 2 has $e^{2 \pi it}$, so $\theta = 2\pi  t$ or $t = \frac{\theta}{2\pi}$ (t is the quantity of interest).
With eulerâ€™s formula, $z = \cos 2\pi t + i \sin 2\pi t$.

Since t is in the unit cube, then $0 \leq t \leq 1$ or $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \leq 1$ or $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$.
(could also multiply t by $2\pi$ to have $0 \leq 2pit \leq 2\pi$).
This imposes a limit on the angle.

Also remember that $|z|^2 = |\hat{z} ^2| = x^2 + y^2$.
So $|z| = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }$.
Which leaves us with $|z| = \sin^2 (2\pi t) + \sin^2 (2\pi t)$.
