\subsubsection{Method of Integrating Factors}


$$
p(t) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(t)y = g(t)
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \mu(t)y \right] =
\mu(t) \frac{dy}{dt} + y \frac{d\mu(t)}{dt} \sim p(t) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(t)y
$$

Another way of writing the above could be
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} + cy = f(t)
$$
If $c$ is a coefficient, then great, but this is another common presentation for equations
that canr eadily be solved by the method of integrating factors.

Also, make sure to remember to do the comparsion of $y \frac{d\mu(t)}{dt}$ properly.
For example, using the last version we wrote, the integrating facotr would come from the comparison of
$$
y \frac{d\mu(t)}{dt} \sim cy\mu(t) \rightarrow \frac{d\mu(t)}{dt} \sim c\mu(t)
$$
That's why we get so many exponentials.

\subsubsection{Separable Equations}

$$
M(x) + N(y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
$$

Can be written in \textbf{differential form} as
$$
M(x)dx + N(y)dy = 0
$$


\subsubsection{Notes}

Sometimes equations of the form
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)
$$
have a constant solution $y = y_0$.

For example,
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(y-3) \cos{x}}{1+2y^2}
$$
Has a constant solution $y=3$.

\subsection{Modeling with First Order Equations}


\subsubsection{Example 1: Mixing}
$$
\frac{d Q}{dt} + \frac{r}{100}Q = \frac{r}{4}
$$

Using the method of Integrating factors, we have
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left[\mu(t)Q(t)\right] = \mu\frac{dQ}{dt} + Q \frac{d\mu}{dt}
= \mu \frac{d Q}{dt} + \mu \frac{r}{100}Q = \mu \frac{r}{4}
$$

Comparing
$$
Q \frac{d\mu}{dt} \sim \mu \frac{r}{100}Q
$$
We have that
$$
\frac{d\mu}{dt} = \frac{r}{100} \mu
$$

So the integrating factor must be
$$
\int \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dt} dt = ln |\mu| 
= \int \frac{r}{100} = \frac{r}{100}t + C_0
$$

And so
$$
\mu(t) = e^{\frac{r}{100}t + C_0} = C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}}
$$

Our original equation becomes

\begin{align*}
    \frac{d}{dt} \left[ C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} Q \right]  &=   
    C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} \frac{d Q}{dt} + C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} \frac{r}{100}Q = C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} \frac{r}{4}
\end{align*}

Now, we can finally integrate both sides,
\begin{align*}
    \int \frac{d}{dt} \left[ C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} Q \right] dt  &=  C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} Q     \\
    &= \int C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} \frac{r}{4} dt    \\
    &= \frac{r}{4} \frac{100}{r} C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} + C_2 \\
    &= 25 C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} + C_2 \\
\end{align*}

So our general solution is
$$
C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} Q = 25 C_1e^{\frac{rt}{100}} + C_2
$$
or
$$
Q = 25 + C e^{\frac{-rt}{100}}
$$

Since $Q(t=0) = Q_0$
$$
Q_0 = 25 + C \rightarrow C = Q_0 - 25
$$

And
\begin{align*}
    Q(t) &= 25 + (Q_0 - 25) e^{\frac{-rt}{100}} \\
    &= 25(1 - e^{\frac{-rt}{100}}) + Q_0 e^{\frac{-rt}{100}}
\end{align*}

When we want to solve for the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2\%$ of $Q_L$ (the limiting ammount),
we do it as follows:
$$
25.5 = 25 + 25 e^{-rT/100} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} = 25 e^{-rT/100}
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{50} = e^{-rT/100} \rightarrow \ln (1/50) = \frac{-rT}{100}
$$
$$
= - \frac{100}{r} \ln(1/50) = \frac{100}{r} \ln{50}
$$


\subsubsection{Example 3: Chemicals in a pond}

We will pick up from
$$
\frac{dt}{dt} + \frac{1}{2}q = 10 + 5\sin(2t)
$$
And we can see that we have a nice, simple, first order, linear equation, so we will proceed with
the method of integrating factors.
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \mu(t) q(t) \right] &= \mu \frac{dq}{dt} + q\frac{d\mu}{dt} \\
&= \mu\frac{dt}{dt} + \frac{1}{2}\mu q = 10\mu + 5\mu\sin(2t)
\end{align*}
Means that the integrating factor will be
$$
q\frac{d\mu}{dt} \sim \frac{1}{2}\mu q \rightarrow
\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dt} \sim \frac{1}{2}
$$
Or
$$
\int \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dt} dt = \int \frac{1}{2}
$$
Which leads to $\mu(t) = e^{t/2}$.

So our equation becomes
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ e^{t/2} q(t) \right] &= e^{t/2} \frac{dt}{dt} + \frac{1}{2} e^{t/2} q = 10 e^{t/2} + 5 e^{t/2} \sin(2t)
\end{align*}

Hence,
\begin{align*}
e^{t/2} q(t) &= \int 10 e^{t/2} dt + \int 5 e^{t/2} \sin(2t) dt \\
&= 20 e^{t/2} + \int 5 e^{t/2} \sin(2t) dt
\end{align*}

Here we have an interesting integral so let's break it down.

\paragraph{An interesting integral}

In the previous expression we ended up with
$$
\int 5 e^{t/2} \sin(2t) dt
$$

The tip here is a chain of integrations by parts and $u$-substitutions.
First, let's recall the rule for integration by parts
$$
\int u dv = uv - \int v du
$$

Now, let's get to it.

\begin{align*}
    \int e^{t/2} \sin(2t) dt &= 
    \left[
      \begin{alignedat}{2}
      u  &= e^{t/2}               \quad & v  &= -\frac{1}{2}\cos(2t) \\
      du &= \frac{1}{2}e^{t/2}dt  \quad & dv &= \sin(2t) dt 
      \end{alignedat}\,
    \right] \\
    &=
    -\frac{1}{2}e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{1}{4} \left[ 
        \frac{1}{2}e^{t/2}\sin(2t) - \frac{1}{4} \int e^{t/2} \sin(2t) dt
    \right] \\
    &= -\frac{1}{2}e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{1}{2^3} e^{t/2}\sin(2t)
      - \frac{1}{2^4} \int e^{t/2}\sin(2t) dt
\end{align*}

Notice that we got our initial integral back, so now some algebra will lead us to
\begin{align*}
\left( \int e^{t/2}\sin(2t) dt \right) \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^4} \right) =
-\frac{1}{2}e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{1}{2^3} e^{t/2}\sin(2t)
\end{align*}

Which can be simplified to
\begin{align*}
\int e^{t/2}\sin(2t) dt   &=
-\frac{2^4}{2}\frac{1}{2^4+1} e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{2^4}{2^3}\frac{1}{2^4+1} e^{t/2}\sin(2t) \\
&= -\frac{2^3}{2^4+1}e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{2}{2^4+1} e^{t/2}\sin(2t)
\end{align*}
\\~\\

Now, we can put everything together!
\begin{align*}
e^{t/2} q(t) &= 20 e^{t/2} + \int 5 e^{t/2} \sin(2t) dt \\
&= 20 e^{t/2} + 5 \left[ -\frac{2^3}{2^4+1}e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{2}{2^4+1} e^{t/2}\sin(2t) \right] \\
&= 20 e^{t/2} -\frac{40}{17}e^{t/2}\cos(2t) + \frac{10}{17} e^{t/2}\sin(2t) + C
\end{align*}

Notice that we trhew in an integration coefficient at the end.
And our final answer is now
$$
q(t) =
20 -\frac{40}{17}\cos(2t) + \frac{10}{17} \sin(2t) + Ce^{-t/2}
$$
