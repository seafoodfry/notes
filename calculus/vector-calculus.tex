\subsection{Parametric Equations in General}

\subsubsection{Cycloid}

The parametric equation for $\overrightarrow{AP}$ looks the way it does because the starting point
if at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.

\subsubsection{Involute of a Circle}

The lenght of $\overrightarrow{BP}$ is $a\theta$ which is the length of the arc! ($s=\theta r$.)

\subsection{The Dot Product}


\subsection{Vector Projections}

\textbf{Example 4}

The magnitude of the projection of $\vect{F}$ onto $\vect{a}$ is equivalent to $\vect{F} \sin(30)$.
That is,
$$
|\text{proj}_{\vect{a}} \vect{F}| = |\vect{F}| \sin 30
$$

Remember that to convert degrees to radians you must multiply degrees by $\pi / 180$.
This works out so because gravity is only acting along a single direction.

\subsection{The Cross Product}


\subsection{Rotation of a Rigid Body}

$|\vect{r}(t)|$ and $\theta$ are constant, but $\vect{r}(t)$ changes direction as time changes.
That change in direction corresponds to a change to the vector $\vect{r}(t)$ and thats
why it corresponds to the arc swept btween $t$ and $t+ \Delta t$.

\textbf{Proposition 4.3}, its proof is similar to an exercise we did for Folland, see
\ref{folland:1.1.7}

\textbf{Proposition 2.1} (foudn in section 1.2)
the vector parametric equation for the line through the point $P_0 (b_1, b_2, b_3)$,
whose position vector is $\overrightarrow{OP_0} = \vect{b} = b_1\vect{i} + b_2\vect{j} + b_3\vect{k}$,
and parallel to $\vect{a} = a_1\vect{i} + a_2\vect{j} + a_3\vect{k}$ is $\vect{r}(t) = \vect{b} + t\vect{a}$.
