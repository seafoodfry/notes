\subsection{Parametric Equations in General}

\subsubsection{Cycloid}

The parametric equation for $\overrightarrow{AP}$ looks the way it does because the starting point
if at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.

\subsubsection{Involute of a Circle}

The lenght of $\overrightarrow{BP}$ is $a\theta$ which is the length of the arc! ($s=\theta r$.)
