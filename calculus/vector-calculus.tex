\subsection{Parametric Equations in General}

\subsubsection{Cycloid}

The parametric equation for $\overrightarrow{AP}$ looks the way it does because the starting point
if at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.

\subsubsection{Involute of a Circle}

The lenght of $\overrightarrow{BP}$ is $a\theta$ which is the length of the arc! ($s=\theta r$.)

\subsection{Vector Projections}

\textbf{Example 4}

The magnitude of the projection of $\vect{F}$ onto $\vect{a}$ is equivalent to $\vect{F} \sin(30)$.
That is,
$$
|\text{proj}_{\vect{a}} \vect{F}| = |\vect{F}| \sin 30
$$

Remember that to convert degrees to radians you must multiply degrees by $\pi / 180$.
This works out so because gravity is only acting along a single direction.
