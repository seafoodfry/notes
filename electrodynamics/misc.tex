\subsubsection{A Propagator}

Describes the amplitude for a particle to propagate from one point to another.

With a source $j(\vect{x}, t)$, the Klein-Gordon equation becomes
$$
\left( \partial^2 + m^2 \right) \psi(\vect{x}, t) = j(\vect{x}, t)
$$

In momentum space the equation is
$$
\left( -\omega^2 + |\vect{k}|^2 + m^2 \right) \tilde{\psi}(\vect{k}, \omega) = \tilde{j}(\vect{\vect{k}, \omega})
$$

$$
\tilde{\psi}(\vect{k}, \omega) = \frac{ \tilde{j}(\vect{\vect{k}, \omega}) }{ \omega^2 - |\vect{k}|^2 - m^2 + i\epsilon }
$$

$i\epsilon$ Feynman's prescription.

The propagator $D_F(x-y)$ is the inverse transform of
$\frac{ 1 }{ \omega^2 - |\vect{k}|^2 - m^2 + i\epsilon }$

$$
D_F(x-y) = \int \frac{d^4k}{(2\pi)^4}
    \frac{ e^{-i(\vect{k}\cdot\vect{x} -\omega t)} }{ \omega^2 - |\vect{k}|^2 - m^2 + i\epsilon }
$$
