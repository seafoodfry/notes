You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my mistake. Let me correct it.

The coefficients $c_i$ are indeed the components of a contravariant vector, and they should transform according to the rule:

$c_{i^{\prime}} = \sum_i A^{i^{\prime}}_{i} c_i$

where $A^{i^{\prime}}_{i}$ is the matrix that transforms the contravariant components.

So, if we have a state vector $\ket{\psi}$ expressed in the $\{\ket{e_i}\}$ basis as:

$\ket{\psi} = \sum_i c_i \ket{e_i}$

and we want to express it in the $\{\ket{e_{i^{\prime}}}\}$ basis as:

$\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i^{\prime}} c_{i^{\prime}} \ket{e_{i^{\prime}}}$

then the new coefficients $c_{i^{\prime}}$ are given by:

$c_{i^{\prime}} = \sum_i A^{i^{\prime}}_{i} c_i$

Here, $A^{i^{\prime}}_{i}$ is the same matrix that transforms the contravariant basis vectors:

$e^{i^{\prime}} = A^{i^{\prime}}_{i} e^i$

Thank you for catching this error and allowing me to correct it. The transformation rule for the coefficients (contravariant components) is indeed $c_{i^{\prime}} = \sum_i A^{i^{\prime}}_{i} c_i$, not $c_{i^{\prime}} = \sum_i (A^{-1})^{i}_{i^{\prime}} c_i$.
