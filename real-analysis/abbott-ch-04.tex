\textbf{4.2.1}
\\

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Supply the details for how Corollary 4.2.4 part (ii) follows from the Sequential Criterion for Functional
Limits in Theorem 4.2.3 and the Algebraic Limit theorem for sequences proved in Chapter 2.
\\

For reference, the Algebraic Limit Theorem is Theorem 2.3.3.



\item Now, write another proof of Corollary 4.2.4 part (ii) directly from Definition 4.2.1 without using the
Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits in Theorem 4.2.3.

\item Repeat (a) and (b) for Corollary 4.2.4 part (iii).
\end{enumerate}
