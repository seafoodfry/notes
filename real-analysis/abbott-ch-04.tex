\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Supply the details for how Corollary 4.2.4 part (ii) follows from the Sequential Criterion for Functional
Limits in Theorem 4.2.3 and the Algebraic Limit Theorem for sequences proved in Chapter 2.
\\

For reference, the Algebraic Limit Theorem is Theorem 2.3.3.

The Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits here tells us that since we know that since
$\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x_n) \rightarrow L$ and
$\lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x_n) \rightarrow M$,
then we know that $(x_n) \rightarrow c$ ($x_n \neq c$ for all $n$)
and that $f(x_n) \rightarrow L$ and $g(x_n) \rightarrow M$.

Since the later two expressions are sequences on their own, we can use now the Algebraic Limit Theorem,
$\lim \left(a_n + b_n\right) = a+b$, implying that
$\lim_{x\rightarrow c} \left( f(x_n) + f(x_n)\right) \rightarrow L + M$.


\item Now, write another proof of Corollary 4.2.4 part (ii) directly from Definition 4.2.1 without using the
Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits in Theorem 4.2.3.

To do the same proof without the Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits we ought to go back to $\epsilon-\delta$ proofs.

Since we know that $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x_n) \rightarrow L$ and
$\lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x_n) \rightarrow M$, then we can define a $\delta_f$ such that when $0 < |x-c| < \delta_f$ $|f(x) - L|<\epsilon_f$
(for any $\epsilon_f > 0$)
and a $\delta_g$ sucht that when $0 < |x-c| < \delta_g$ $|g(x) - M| < \epsilon_g$ (for any $\epsilon_g > 0$).

Then if we look for a $\delta = \min\left\{\delta_f, \delta_g \right\}$ such that
$$
\left| \left(f(x)+g(x)\right) - \left(L+M\right) \right| \leq
\left|f(x) - L \right| + \left| g(x) - M \right| < \epsilon_f + \epsilon_g = \epsilon
$$

If you notice, this is pretty much the same sort of logic we used to prove the Algebraic Limit Theorem, so we could
have a guess for what the proof for the next bit could be.

\item Repeat (a) and (b) for Corollary 4.2.4 part (iii).

The proof using the Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits is essentially the same as in part (a).
(You should definetely write it out or read it out loud though!)
So let's carry on with the proof without it.

Similar to what we did while proving the Algebraic Limit Theorem, let's work backwards from what we want.

\begin{align*}
\left| f(x)g(x) - LM \right| &=  \left| f(x)g(x) - Lg(x) + Lg(x) - LM \right| \\
&\leq \left| f(x)g(x) - Lg(x) \right| + \left| Lg(x) - LM \right| \\
&= |g(x)| \left| f(x) - L \right| + |L|\left| g(x) - M \right|
\end{align*}

Again, we want to find the "worst case scenario" for $g(x)$.
And since $g(x_n)$ is a convergent sequence, then it will have some bound $M$.
If we also recall our $\delta_f$ and $\delta_g$ from part (b), then we have

\begin{align*}
\left| f(x)g(x) - LM \right| &\leq |g(x)| \left| f(x) - L \right| + |L|\left| g(x) - M \right| \\
&\leq M \left| f(x) - L \right| + |L|\left| g(x) - M \right| \\
&< |M| \epsilon_f + |L| \epsilon_g \\
&= |M| \left( \frac{\epsilon}{2|M|} \right) + |L|\left( \frac{\epsilon}{2|L|} \right) = \epsilon
\end{align*}

At the end there, we went ahead and figured out how to define $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ in terms of some arbitrary $\epsilon$
that could be used for the entire thing.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{4.2.2}
\\

For each stated limit, find the largest possible $\delta$-neighborhood that is a proper response to the $\epsilon$-challenge.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} \left( 5x - 6 \right) = 9$, where $\epsilon = 1$.

\item $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4} \sqrt{x} = 2$, where $\epsilon = 1$.

\item $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pi} [[x]] = 3$, where $\epsilon = 1$.
(The function $[[x]]$ returns the greatest integer less than or ewual to $x$.)

\item $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pi} [[x]]$, where $\epsilon = 0.01$.
\end{enumerate}
