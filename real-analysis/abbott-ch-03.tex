\subsection{Open and Closed Sets}

The empy set $\emptyset$ is considered an open subset of the real line, becuase if it wans't it would imply
that there is something in the emptyset that is "closed"
(negation of "for all $a\in O$ there exist a $V_\epsilon \subseteq O$").
\\

There is a theorem mentioned in topology that goes something along the lines of:
the union of two non-disjoint intervals is an interval.
The idea behind it being that in order for something to be an interval, it must must not have gaps
between its endpoints.
For example, the union of $[0,1] \cup [2,3]$ is not an internal since it doesn't include $[1,2]$.
\\

Open balls or $\epsilon$-neighborhoods make sense right away until you ought to give a proper argument.
The way to read the definitions for these is to think that you always want a "ball" around some
point, and you want to see if balls of any radius will be able to fit within another interval.
For example, in Abbott example 3.2.2(ii), we take $\epsilon$ to be some positive value by
looking at the difference between the point $x\in(c,d)$ and its left and right endpoints.
($x-c > 0$ and $d-x > 0$). (It must be a strict inequality because otherwise $|x-a| < 0$ would cause us trouble.)
And that definition of $\epsilon$ gives you a simple way to look for open balls in $(c,d)$.

To see the above, draw out a line and see how no matter what radius you end up using, as long as
it is less than $\epsilon$, all the open balls you draw will fit within $(c,d)$.
\\

\textbf{Theorem 3.2.3}

Note the interesting bit of logic being used here: since $O_{\lambda^\prime}$ is open then
$V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda^\prime}$.
Since $O_{\lambda^\prime}$ is some arbitrary member of $O = \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} O_{\lambda}$,
then $O_{\lambda^\prime} \subseteq O$.
Putting these together $V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda^\prime} \subseteq O$.
\\

\textbf{Definition 3.2.4}
By now, we've seen that $\epsilon$-neighboorhods are equivalent to open balls,
$$
V_{\epsilon} (a) \sim B(r=\epsilon, a) \sim \{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n : |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}| < r(=\epsilon) \}
$$
The neighboorhod part comes from $x\in S^{int} = \{ \mathbf{x}\in S : B(r,\mathbf{x}) \in S \text{ for some } r>0 \}$.
Which is a math way of saying that a neighboorhod consist of all points close to our center who are
still members of the set in question.
\\

Folland gives a conventional view of a closed set by first defining \textbf{boundary points}
of a set as points where every ball centered on them contains points both in $S$ and $S^c$,
These points may then belong to either the set in question or its compliment ($x\in S \cup S^v$).
And the set of all boundary points creates a boundary for $S$
$$
\partial S = \{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n : B(r,\mathbf{x})\cap S \neq \emptyset \text{ and }
    B(r,\mathbf{x})\cap S^c \neq \emptyset \}
$$

However, instead of following this route, Abbott goes onto to construct closed intervals
with limit points which instead of relying on geometry, relies on our knowledge of series.

The definition of a limit point is literally the defintion of the limit of a sequence in terms of
$\epsilon$-neighboorhods as $\lim (a_n) = x \rightarrow |a_n - x| < \epsilon$.
\\~\\


\textbf{Theorem 3.2.5}

Notice how in the first part of the proof we are being told about an $\epsilon = 1/n$.
This is because when we prove that a limit exist, we must always provide a relationship for an
$\epsilon = \epsilon (n)$ so that $|a_n - x|<\epsilon$.
\\


\textbf{Example 3.2.9}

The first example is $A = \{ \frac{1}{n} : n\in\mathbb{N} \}$, when $\epsilon = 1/n - 1/(n+1)$.
Abbott helps us out here because otherwise we would have to figure out how to prove that
1.) the limit point is zero (but that is not in A), 2.) every other $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either
$1/n$ or it never intersects with other member of A (think about some $(1/n - \epsilon, 1/n +\epsilon)$).

In our case it helps to see it this way,
\begin{align*}
v_{\epsilon} (1/n) &= \{ x\in\mathbb{R} : \left|x - \frac{1}{n}\right| < \epsilon \} = \left(\frac{1}{n} - \epsilon, \frac{1}{n} + \epsilon \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{2}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{2n + 2 - n}{n(n+1)} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{n + 2}{n(n+1)} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{n}{n(n+1)}, \frac{n + 2}{n(n+1)} \right)
\end{align*}

The only number we can put in between that interval, following our requirements, is $\frac{n+1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n}$.
\\~\\


\textbf{Theorem 3.2.13}
In the first part of the proof, we want to prove that $O^c$ contains all of its limit points.
Containing all of its limits points means that every $\epsilon$-neighboorhod of any limit point would
contain other points in $O^c$.
That is why if $x\in O$ would lead to a contradiction: if a single $x \notin O^c$, then at least one of its
$V_\epsilon (x) \subseteq O$ ($O$ and $O^c$ have no members in commmon, so if an $\epsilon$-neighboorhod is contained
in one then it cannot contain points in the other.)

When reading the converse statement, again, keep in mind that the concept of limit points is to look for
neighborhoods that are fully contained within a set, every $o \in v_\epsilon $ is also $x \ in O$ if
$v_\epsilon \in O$.
So looking at a limit point that is not part of $O^c$, means that $v_{\epsilon} (x) \in O$ by definition.

\subsubsection{Exercises}

\textbf{3.2.1}

\textbf{(a)} Where in the proof of Theorem 3.2.3 part (ii) does the assumption that the collection of
open sets be finite gets used?
\\

Theorem 3.2.3 states that: the intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
The "finite-ness" is used when we look for the smallest $\epsilon$-neighborhood contained in every $O_k$.
If we assume that we are looking at the intersection of an infinite ammount of open sets, then the nested-interval
property doesn't hold and we cannot guarantee that there is an element contained within the inifity of neighborhoods (it may or mat not exist).
See \ref{abbott:1.4.3}.
\\~\\

\textbf{(b)} Give an example of a countable collectionof open sets $\{O_1, O_2, O_3, \ldots\}$
whose intersection $\cup^{\infty}_{n=1} O_n$ is closed, not empty and not all of $\mathbb{R}$.
\\~\\


\textbf{3.2.2}

Let
$$
A = \left\{ (-1)^n + \frac{2}{n} : n\in\mathbb{N} \right\},
$$
$$
B = \left\{ x \in\mathbb{Q} : 0 < x < 1 \right\},
$$
and
$$
C = \left\{ \frac{(-1)^n n}{n+1} : n\in\mathbb{N} \right\}
$$

\textbf{(a)} what are the limit points?
\\

Let's plugin a couple numbers!
In $A$, when $n=1$ we got $-1 + 2 = 1$; when $n=2$, $1 + 1 = 2$; $n=3$, $-1 + 2/3 = -1/3$; $n=4$, $1 + 1/2 = 3/2$;
so $A = \{ 1, 2, -\frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{3}{5}, \ldots \}$.
Holistically, the first term oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, while the second one is monotonically decreasing
starting at 2 and then decreasing to 0 as $n$ grows unbounded.
Since we are adding or subtracting monotonically decreasing terms to -1 and 1, and since the first two terms are 1 and 2,
then all other values will oscillate between the two, getting closer and closer to both of those values.
So our limit points here are $1$ and $-1$. (they are literally the limit of a sequence contained in $A$.)

Now, $B$.
Back in \textbf{example 3.2.9}, we saw that a property of $\mathbb{Q}$ is that its set of limit points is \textbf{ALL}
of $\mathbb{R}$.
So the set of limit points for $B$ is not just 0 and 1 but the entire interval $[0,1]$.

Finally $C$. Again, plugin in some numbers, $n=1$; $-1/2$; $n=2$, $2/3$, etc.
So, we get $C = \{-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, -\frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \ldots, \frac{10}{11}, -\frac{11}{12}, \ldots \}$.
We again see that the elements of $C$ approach -1 and 1 as $n$ grows without bounds.
So the limit points are -1 and 1.

Let's do a bit more work for $C$, just because.
We can see that a limit point for $C$ is 1 because the even terms grow as $(\frac{n}{n+1})$.
The difference between consecutive even terms is
$\left|\frac{n}{n+1} - \frac{n+2}{n+3}\right| = \left|\frac{3(n+3) - (n+1(n+2))}{(n+1)(n+3)}\right| = \left|\frac{-2}{(n+1)(n+3)}\right| = \frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)}$.
We want to use this data to verify that every $\epsilon$-neighboorhod of a limit point does indeed intercept our set $C$
at some point other than the limit point we are looking at.
Which means that we want to see $V_{\epsilon} (1) \cap C \neq \emptyset$ and $V_{\epsilon} (1) \cap C \neq 1$.
We can see $V_{\epsilon} (1) \cap C \neq \emptyset$ right away since $\frac{n}{n+1} \neq 1$ ever.
Leaving us with the task of verifying that $\{ x\in\mathbb{R} : |x-1| < \epsilon \} \cap C \neq \emptyset$ for all $\epsilon > 0$.
The previous expression can in turn be simplified to $\{ c_n\in C : |c_n - 1| < \epsilon \}$
\textbf{which just magically became a restatement of the criteria for the convergence of a series!} -
think about it, we want to find values in our neighboorhod that intercept with $C$, so instead of searching through all of $\mathbb{R}$
we could search through $C$.
This onw reduces to $\left| \frac{n}{n+1} - 1 \right| = \frac{1}{n+1} < \epsilon$.
Since $ \frac{1}{n+1} > \frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)}$, the distance between two terms in the series, we should be able to
find elements of $C$ within our $\epsilon$-neighboorhods.

Note that in all of these cases we could readily evaluate the limits to get the limit points because the limit points
are not actually memebers of the sets.
\\


\textbf{(b)} Are the sets open or closed?
\\

$A$ is not closed because it doesn't contain all of its limit points, $-1 \notin A$.
But $A$ is also not open since every $V_\epsilon (a), a\in A$ will have some irrational number that is not part of A,
so there is not an $V_{\epsilon} (a) \subseteq A$ (tere isn't a neighborhood that is completely within $A$).

Similarly, $B$ is not closed, because it doesn't not contain its limit points, and also not open
because every $V_\epsilon (b), b\in B$ is not completely contained within $B$
(continuous $\epsilon$-neighboorhods are not a subset of $B$).

Same story for $C$.
\\


\textbf{(c)} Do the set contain isolated points?
\\


Every point in $A$ except 1 and -1 are isolated points.

In the case of $B$, $B$ is dense in $[0,1]$ - every $b\in B \subseteq [0,1]$ - so $B \setminus [0,1] = \emptyset$, so
$B$ has no isolated points.

Finally, all elements in $C$ are isolated points.
\\

\textbf{(d)} Find the closure of the sets.
\\

Our closures are, $\bar{A} = A \cup \{-1, 1\}$, $\bar{B} = [0,1]$, and $\bar{C} = C \cup \{-1, 1\}$.
\\~\\



\textbf{3.2.3}

Decide whether the following sets are open, closed, or neither.
If a set is not open, find a point in the set for which there is no $\epsilon$-neighborhood contained in the set.
If a set is not closed, find a limit point that is not contained in the set. 
\\

\textbf{(a)} $\mathbb{Q}$
\\

Abbott already shared with us that all the reals are the limit points for $\mathbb{Q}$.
So $\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed.
But we also already noted in the previous exercise that continuous $\epsilon$-neighboorhods are not contained in
$\mathbb{Q}$ - for all elements in $\mathbb{Q}$, it is not the case that there is an $\epsilon$-neighboorhod
that is contained within $\mathbb{Q}$, $V_\epsilon (q) \not\subseteq \mathbb{Q}$.

Another way of putting it: $\mathbb{Q}$ is not is not open because irrationals in the $\epsilon$-neighboorhods
are not part of $\mathbb{Q}$. And $\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed because it contains irrational limit points.
\\

\textbf{(b)} $\mathbb{N}$
\\

It is not open by the same logic as above.
$\mathbb{N}$ has no limit points, but it is considered closed.

Think about the two definitions for limit points that we have: there is no sequence contained within $\mathbb{N}$
with a limit and also, it is not the case that every $\epsilon$-neighboorhod intercepts $\mathbb{N}$.
\\

\textbf{(c)} $\{ x\in\mathbb{R} : x \neq 0 \}$
\\

$\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ is open because every element has an $\epsilon$-neighboorhod that intercepts
$\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ at a point other than itself.
It is not closed because 0 is a limit point but it is not included - for example, $1/n \rightarrow 0$.
\\

\textbf{(d)} $\left\{ \sum \frac{1}{n^2} : n\in\mathbb{N} \right\}$
\\

The limit of the sum is $\pi^2 / 6$, its elements are $\{1, 5/4, \ldots \}$.
So similar sitation as above, it is not closed because it doesn't contain its limit.
It is also not open since it only contains rationals.
\\

\textbf{(e)} $\left\{ \sum \frac{1}{n} : n\in\mathbb{N} \right\}$
\\
Similar logic to the previous answer but this time the set is closed since $\sum 1/n$ doesn't converge,
so there is no limit point.
It is not open for the same reasons  as above.
\\~\\




\textbf{3.2.4}
\\

Let $A$ be nonempty and bounded above so that $s = \sup A$ exists.

\textbf{(a)} Show that $s\in \bar{A}$
\\

Interestingly, this exercise is a great connection to \ref{abbott:1.3.3} where we find out that if a set is closed
then the supremum of the set is a member of the set.

In general, $\bar{A} = A \cup L$, where $L$ is the set of limit points.
So one way to try and prove this is to see whether $s \in L$, or in general $s \in A$.
If you remember \textbf{lemma 1.3.8},
it states that if $s \in \mathbb{R}$ is an upper bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
then $s = \sup A$ if and only if, \textbf{for every} choice of $\epsilon > 0$,
there exists an element $a \in A$ satisfying $s - \epsilon < a$.

Now, if you remember the definition of a limit point, it states that a limit point is a limit point
if every $\epsilon$-neighboorhod of a limit point intercepts the set $A$ at some point other than itself.
Using lemma 1.38, we can see then that every $V_\epsilon (s)$ will contain some $a$ such that $s - \epsilon < a$.
Hence, \textbf{we can think of the supremum as a limit point}.
\\

\textbf{(b)} Can an open set contain its supremum?
\\

This is a great exercise because it gives us the opportunity to go from hypothesis to proof.
Based on what we know about supremums, it would be reasonable to doubt that an open set will contain its supremum.
So let's try and prove that directly.

If $A$ is an open set, then it means that every $a \in A$ has a $V_\epsilon (a)$ such that $V_{\epsilon} (a) \subseteq A$.
That is, there is at least one $\epsilon$-neighboorhod for every element of $A$ that is equal to or a subset of $A$.
Which means that at least one $\epsilon$-neighboorhod contains to elements external to $A$.
This means that if we wanted to show that $s \not\in A$ then we would need to show that every $V_\epsilon (s)$
contains elements that are outside of $A$.
To see this, remember that $s$ is the least upper bound, so any $s+\epsilon$ will be an upper bound but it will be
outside the range of $A$.
If $s+\epsilon \in A$, then it would mean that $s \neq \sup A$.
\\~\\




\textbf{3.2.5}
\\

\textbf{Theorem 3.2.8} A set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every
Cauchy sequence contained in $F$ has a limit that is also contained in $F$.
\\

Quick reminder, a Cauchy sequence $(a_n)$ is one which for every $\epsilon >0$
$\exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $m,n \geq N$ $|a_n - a_m| < \epsilon$.
And we also know that every convergent sequence is also a Cauchy sequence.
\\

Let's assume that every Cauchy sequence we know is contained in $F$ and their limits are too contained in $F$.
Since Cauchy sequences are convergent sequences, then it means that all the limit points we can find
will be contained in $F$, thus meeting the defintion of a closed set.
\\

The above argument was the proof for the backwards direction, now let's go forward.
Assume that $F$ is closed.
Since $F$ is closed, then it must contain all of its limit points.
Since every limit point, $l$, is the limit of some sequence contained in $F$, then it means that we have
$\lim (f_n) = l$.
And since every convergent sequence is a cauchy seuqnece, then we can state our theorem.
\\~\\



\textbf{Exercise 3.2.12}
\\

Let $A$ be an uncountable set and let $B$ be the set of real numbers that divides $A$ into two uncountable sets;
that is, $s \in B$ if both $\{ x : x \in A, \quad x < s \}$ and $\{ x : x \in A, \quad x > s\}$ are uncountable.
Show that $B$ is nonempty and open.
\\
