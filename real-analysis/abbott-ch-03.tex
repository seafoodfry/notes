\subsection{Open and Closed Sets}

The empy set $\emptyset$ is considered an open subset of the real line, becuase if it wans't it would imply
that there is something in the emptyset that is "closed"
(negation of "for all $a\in O$ there exist a $V_\epsilon \subseteq O$").
\\

There is a theorem mentioned in topology that goes something along the lines of:
the union of two non-disjoint intervals is an interval.
The idea behind it being that in order for something to be an interval, it must must not have gaps
between its endpoints.
For example, the union of $[0,1] \cup [2,3]$ is not an internal since it doesn't include $[1,2]$.
\\

Open balls or $\epsilon$-neighborhoods make sense right away until you ought to give a proper argument.
The way to read the definitions for these is to think that you always want a "ball" around some
point, and you want to see if balls of any radius will be able to fit within another interval.
For example, in Abbott example 3.2.2(ii), we take $\epsilon$ to be some positive value by
looking at the difference between the point $x\in(c,d)$ and its left and right endpoints.
($x-c > 0$ and $d-x > 0$). (It must be a strict inequality because otherwise $|x-a| < 0$ would cause us trouble.)
And that definition of $\epsilon$ gives you a simple way to look for open balls in $(c,d)$.

To see the above, draw out a line and see how no matter what radius you end up using, as long as
it is less than $\epsilon$, all the open balls you draw will fit within $(c,d)$.
\\

\textbf{Theorem 3.2.3}

Note the interesting bit of logic being used here: since $O_{\lambda^\prime}$ is open then
$V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda^\prime}$.
Since $O_{\lambda^\prime}$ is some arbitrary member of $O = \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} O_{\lambda}$,
then $O_{\lambda^\prime} \subseteq O$.
Putting these together $V_{\epsilon}(a) \subseteq O_{\lambda^\prime} \subseteq O$.
\\

\textbf{Definition 3.2.4}
By now, we've seen that $\epsilon$-neighboorhods are equivalent to open balls,
$$
V_{\epsilon} (a) \sim B(r=\epsilon, a) \sim \{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n : |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}| < r(=\epsilon) \}
$$
The neighboorhod part comes from $x\in S^{int} = \{ \mathbf{x}\in S : B(r,\mathbf{x}) \in S \text{ for some } r>0 \}$.
Which is a math way of saying that a neighboorhod consist of all points close to our center who are
still members of the set in question.
\\

Folland gives a conventional view of a closed set by first defining \textbf{boundary points}
of a set as points where every ball centered on them contains points both in $S$ and $S^c$,
These points may then belong to either the set in question or its compliment ($x\in S \cup S^v$).
And the set of all boundary points creates a boundary for $S$
$$
\partial S = \{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n : B(r,\mathbf{x})\cap S \neq \emptyset \text{ and }
    B(r,\mathbf{x})\cap S^c \neq \emptyset \}
$$

However, instead of following this route, Abbott goes onto to construct closed intervals
with limit points which instead of relying on geometry, relies on our knowledge of series.

The definition of a limit point is literally the defintion of the limit of a sequence in terms of
$\epsilon$-neighboorhods as $\lim (a_n) = x \rightarrow |a_n - x| < \epsilon$.
\\~\\


\textbf{Theorem 3.2.5}

Notice how in the first part of the proof we are being told about an $\epsilon = 1/n$.
This is because when we prove that a limit exist, we must always provide a relationship for an
$\epsilon = \epsilon (n)$ so that $|a_n - x|<\epsilon$.
\\


\textbf{Example 3.2.9}

The first example is $A = \{ \frac{1}{n} : n\in\mathbb{N} \}$, when $\epsilon = 1/n - 1/(n+1)$.
Abbott helps us out here because otherwise we would have to figure out how to prove that
1.) the limit point is zero (but that is not in A), 2.) every other $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either
$1/n$ or it never intersects with other member of A (think about some $(1/n - \epsilon, 1/n +\epsilon)$).

In our case it helps to see it this way,
\begin{align*}
v_{\epsilon} (1/n) &= \{ x\in\mathbb{R} : \left|x - \frac{1}{n}\right| < \epsilon \} = \left(\frac{1}{n} - \epsilon, \frac{1}{n} + \epsilon \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{2}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{2n + 2 - n}{n(n+1)} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{n + 2}{n(n+1)} \right) \\
&= \left(\frac{n}{n(n+1)}, \frac{n + 2}{n(n+1)} \right)
\end{align*}

The only number we can put in between that interval, following our requirements, is $\frac{n+1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n}$.
\\~\\


\textbf{Theorem 3.2.13}
In the first part of the proof, we want to prove that $O^c$ contains all of its limit points.
Containing all of its limits points means that every $\epsilon$-neighboorhod of any limit point would
contain other points in $O^c$.
That is why if $x\in O$ would lead to a contradiction: if a single $x \notin O^c$, then at least one of its
$V_\epsilon (x) \subseteq O$ ($O$ and $O^c$ have no members in commmon, so if an $\epsilon$-neighboorhod is contained
in one then it cannot contain points in the other.)

When reading the converse statement, again, keep in mind that the concept of limit points is to look for
neighborhoods that are fully contained within a set, every $o \in v_\epsilon $ is also $x \ in O$ if
$v_\epsilon \in O$.
So looking at a limit point that is not part of $O^c$, means that $v_{\epsilon} (x) \in O$ by definition.

\subsubsection{Exercises}

\textbf{3.2.1}

\textbf{(a)} Where in the proof of Theorem 3.2.3 part (ii) does the assumption that the collection of
open sets be finite gets used?
\\

Theorem 3.2.3 states that: the intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
The "finite-ness" is used when we look for the smallest $\epsilon$-neighborhood contained in every $O_k$.
If we assume that we are looking at the intersection of an infinite ammount of open sets, then the nested-interval
property doesn't hold and we cannot guarantee that there is an element contained within the inifity of neighborhoods.
See \ref{abbott:1.4.3} to see why.
\\~\\

\textbf{(b)} Give an example of a countable collectionof open sets $\{O_1, O_2, O_3, \ldots\}$
whose intersection $\cup^{\infty}_{n=1} O_n$ is closed, not empty and not all of $\mathbb{R}$.
\\

\textbf{3.2.5}

\textbf{Theorem 3.2.8} A set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every
Cauchy sequence contained in $F$ has a limit that is also contained in $F$.
\\

Quick reminder, a Cauchy sequence $(a_n)$ is one which for every $\epsilon >0$
$\exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $m,n \geq N$ $|a_n - a_m| < \epsilon$.
And we also know that every convergent sequence is also a Cauchy sequence.
\\

For any $m,n \geq N$, $|f_n - f_m| < \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon$.
From this part of the definition of Cauchy sequences we can start forming $\epsilon$-neighboorhods
around any $f_i \in F$, $i \geq N$.
And because Cauchy sequences converge, $(f_n) \rightarrow x$, then our $\epsilon$-beighborhoods
will all contain elements of $F$, and we can change $m,n$ so as to have $f_n \neq x$.
Thus all of the limit poins will be contained in our set $F$.
\\

To do the proof in the other direction, assume that every Cauchy sequence we can find has a limit
contained in $F$.
Because Cauchy sequences converge, then we have $|f_n - x| < \epsilon$ - elements of $F$
that are within $\epsilon$-neighborhoods that intersect other members of $F$ since $|f_n - f_m|<\epsilon$.
