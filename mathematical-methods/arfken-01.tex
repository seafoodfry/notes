\subsection{Infinite Series}

A necessary condition for convergence of an Infinite series to a limit $S$ is that
$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} u_n = 0$, where $u_n$ is a term in the series.
However, the above condition is not sufficient to guarantee convergence.

The argument for this is presented in Abbott in Theorem 2.7.2, the Cauchy criterion for series,
and in Theorem 2.7.3.
