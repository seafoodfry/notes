\subsection{Infinite Series}

A necessary condition for convergence of an Infinite series to a limit $S$ is that
$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} u_n = 0$, where $u_n$ is a term in the series.
However, the above condition is not sufficient to guarantee convergence.

The argument for this is presented in Abbott in Theorem 2.7.2, the Cauchy criterion for series,
and in Theorem 2.7.3.

While looking at the D'Alembert (Cauchy) ratio test, keep in mind that the geometric
series defines $r = u_{n+1} / u_n$.

Also, in Example 1.1.4, we have the $n \geq 2$ condition because if $n = 1$,
then we would have an undeterminate result.
